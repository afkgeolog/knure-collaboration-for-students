Currently, it is unhandy to share the files and relevant information about study process. Has the lesson been cancelled? Is there new valuable information about the teacher or subject? Has the lesson been moved to another classroom? Where to find all materials related to the subject? How many practical classes are left in this semester?  This application is the answer on all of them.
